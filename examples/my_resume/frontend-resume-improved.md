### Professional Summary
A product-minded Frontend Engineer with over 6 years of experience building high-scale web applications. From scaling internal tools at **ByteDance** to launching 0-to-1 AI products at **Jobright**, I specialize in React/Next.js ecosystems and performance optimization. Lately, I’ve been focused on bridging the gap between AI and developer productivity, building custom LLM-driven tools and agentic workflows that redefine the engineering lifecycle.

### Experience

**Bybit** | *Frontend Engineer* | Sep 2024 – Present
*   **High-Stakes Financial Engineering:** Orchestrated the frontend architecture for core financial products including **Spot Trading, Launchpool, Megadrop, and Lending (Loan)**. Managed high-frequency data streams and state synchronization (Zustand) to ensure millisecond-accurate user experiences, maintaining a 100% stable production record with zero P0 incidents during extreme traffic spikes.
*   **Next-Gen Agentic Workflows:** Pioneering an AI-native development lifecycle by integrating Claude with internal toolchains (Lark OpenAPI, Figma-MCP). Designed an automated pipeline that ingests PRDs and API designs to generate data-flow diagrams and business logic. Implemented a "human-in-the-loop" plan mode for architectural alignment, ensuring high-fidelity synchronization between product requirements, design mocks, and final code.
*   **Evolutionary AI Code Review Ecosystem:** Led a multi-stage initiative to build a codebase-aware agentic review system, evolving from basic IDE chat extensions (VS Code/JetBrains) into a fully integrated CI/CD workflow. To solve "context blindness" in file-level reviews, I engineered a **Repo Map** using **Tree-sitter** and a **PageRank-based retrieval engine** to inject level-1 dependencies, references, and RAG-based documentation into the LLM context. Navigated enterprise security by deploying **self-hosted models** on internal cloud and connecting them to **GitLab MR hooks**. By pivoting to a **Claude Code agentic system** utilizing LSP and sub-agents for specific scenario, and deployed with claude agent sdk,  increased the suggestion adoption rate from 15% to **over 50%**.
*   **Performance & Resilience:** Led a performance task force that brought LCP P90 under 2s using `react-scan` for deep-dive render analysis under 4x CPU throttling. Engineered a Service Worker-based "Smart Proxy" to mitigate regional domain blocking, securing uninterrupted access for 1,000+ daily active users on the Bybit PC client.

**Jobright Inc.** | *Frontend Engineer* | Aug 2023 – Aug 2024
*   **0-to-1 Product Launch:** Acted as the primary frontend lead for [jobright.ai](https://jobright.ai/), taking the platform from a blank canvas to 30,000+ users. Scaled the architecture using Next.js and Zustand to support 5,000+ DAU within the first year.
*   **Growth & SEO Engineering:** Led a comprehensive SEO strategy (SSG/ISR, JSON-LD, and Semantic HTML) that achieved Lighthouse scores of 90+. This directly improved indexing and organic click-through rates for key landing pages.
*   **User Productivity Tools:** Developed a Chrome extension (WXT/React) that automates resume and job form filling for sites like LinkedIn and Indeed, successfully serving over 100,000 users.
*   **DevOps & Efficiency:** Cut CI/CD pipeline times by 30% by optimizing Docker BuildKit layers and unified the API contract process using OpenAPI schema synchronization, significantly reducing integration bugs.

**ByteDance** | *Frontend Engineer* | Jun 2020 – Jul 2023
*   **Data Visualization at Scale:** Built the frontend for ByteCloud’s monitoring and alerting systems. Handled massive datasets using Web Workers and ECharts to ensure smooth, lag-free interactions for operations dashboards.
*   **Internal Automation:** Created a full-stack dashboard platform (React/Node/MongoDB) that automated weekly reporting for a 100-person team, eliminating hours of manual data collation every week.
*   **Micro-Frontend Architecture:** Modernized the build system by implementing Turborepo and Webpack Module Federation. This transition slashed average build times from 10+ minutes to under 5 minutes and allowed teams to deploy submodules independently.

**Zhejiang Daily Press Group** | *Full-Stack Engineer* | Jun 2018 – May 2020
*   **Internal Data Products:** Delivered end-to-end internal tools using Java (Spring Boot) and Vue.js, providing the editorial and ops teams with reliable analytics.
*   **Mobile Ecosystem:** Developed and shipped multiple WeChat Mini Programs and H5 applications to digitize internal workflows.

### Key Projects

**Asksia (AI Homework Assistant)** | [asksia.ai](https://www.asksia.ai/)
*   Built a full-stack AI tutor from scratch using Next.js and Supabase. Implemented intelligent intent detection and context management to provide students with accurate, conversational help.

**LangLink Translation Extension** | [Link](https://acesse.one/1bQ94)
*   Developed a specialized translation tool using a FastAPI backend and React frontend. Integrated OpenRouter to allow users to toggle between LLMs for the most context-aware translations.
