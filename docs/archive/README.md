# Archive

This directory stores completed or outdated documents kept for historical context.

## Structure

- `plans/completed/` - Planning docs that have already been implemented
- `plans/superseded/` - Older plans replaced by newer versions
- `research/` - Research notes that are no longer active references
- `sessions/` - Session notes that are historical (completed UX changes or old troubleshooting)

## Current Archived Docs

- `plans/completed/multi-provider-llm-architecture.md`
- `plans/completed/llm-framework-research.md`
- `plans/superseded/web-productization-roadmap.md`
- `research/vercel-ai-sdk-analysis.md`
- `sessions/CHANGELOG.md`

## Rule of Thumb

- Keep active docs in `docs/plans`, `docs/setup`, `docs/usage`, etc.
- Move docs here when work is done or the content is no longer authoritative.
- Prefer moving over deleting when the doc may still be useful for context.
- If a troubleshooting page reflects an old bug/fix only, archive it instead of keeping it in active docs.
