# Completed Plans

This folder stores finished plans for historical traceability.

## Move Rule

Move a plan from `docs/plans/active/` to this folder when:

1. Scope is fully delivered or explicitly closed.
2. Validation evidence is attached.
3. Follow-up work (if any) is captured as a new active plan.

## Naming

Use filename format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-<short-topic>.md`
