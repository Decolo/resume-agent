# packages/contracts

Shared contract package for API/session schemas and constants.

Ownership:

1. Contract modules live in `packages/contracts/resume_agent_contracts/*`.
2. Contracts are intentionally app/core/provider agnostic.
3. Legacy `resume_agent/contracts/*` compatibility wrappers have been retired.
